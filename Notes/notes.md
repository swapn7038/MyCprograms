Summary 


1. Chapter 
  There are four important aspects of any language 
  1) the way it stored data, 
  2) the way it operates upon this data, 
  3) how it accomplishes input and output 
  4) how it lets you control the sequence of execution of instruction in a programm 
: C dev at AT&T`s Bell Lab in 1972 // Designed and named   by Dennis Ritchie. 

 Features of C 
1. Reliable 
2. Simple and easy to use 

Why to learn C today 
 1. Nobody can learn C++ or Java directly today. They have  very complicated concepts such as : classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exception handling, references. 
 2. C++, Java or C# have principle called as OOP to organize the program. 
 3. Part og OS like Linux, UNIX is written in C // This is because even today come to performance (Speed of execution ) nothing beats C. 
 4. At times one is required to very closely interact with the hardware devices. C has more advantage.

Type of constants 
1. Promary : Integer Constants, Real Constants, Character Constant
2. Secondary : Array, Pointer, Structure, Union, Enum

Rules for constructiong Integer Constants 
1. must have at least one digit
2. must have no decimal point 
3. either positive or negative
4. if no sign, then assumed to be positive
5. no commmas or blanks are allowed within integer
6. Allowable range for integer constant in -32768 to 32767 

// Truely speaking range of integer constant depends on compiler. for 16-bit range is -32768 to 32767 

Rules for constructing real constants  often called as Floating point constants // could be written in fraction and Exponential form 
1. must have at least one digit 
2. must have decimal point 
3. no commas or blank space is allowed
